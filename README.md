This is my TODO app, aptly named TODO:

Currently planned features in no particular order:
    - Full screen dialog boxes.
    - Advanced list adding (e.g. type, color coding, etc).
    - Bringing color wheel to live (can currently change list type to "color" with react extension).
    - Touch screen compatibility for color picker.
    - Enforcing 19 character limit on list names, or truncating them in the view.
    - Client side object persistence.
    - User authentication/registration.
    - Backend data storage.
